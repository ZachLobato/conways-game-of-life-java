# Game of Life
Author: Zach Lobato

## Description
This is Conway's game of life. A short project inspired by the Justin Searls' Discovery Testing methodology, but tweaked to follow more traditional OOP practices. This implemenation of the Game of Life, does have the capability to grow infinitely in all directions. Because it was developed with "Worlds" (or states), it can also be easliy modified to add a history (undo-redo functionality).
